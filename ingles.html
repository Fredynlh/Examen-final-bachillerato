            <h4 class="h4-anecdote">Personal Anecdote and Lessons Learned</h4>
            <p>One of the most defining moments in my recent years occurred in 2022 when my cousin came to live with us. We ended up sharing the same room, which was both exciting and challenging. While our relationship was already strong, living together brought us even closer, deepening our family bond in ways I hadn’t anticipated. This experience taught me the value of patience, understanding, and compromise—skills that I believe are essential in all aspects of life, whether personal or professional.</p>
            <p>However, 2022 was also a year that tested my ability to handle conflict. I found myself in a situation at school where a misunderstanding escalated into a physical altercation with two other students. Looking back, it was not my proudest moment. But the incident taught me an important lesson about the consequences of impulsive actions. It was my friend Mario who stepped in, helping me to see the situation from a different perspective and guiding me through the aftermath. His intervention made me realize the importance of resolving conflicts with maturity and calmness, rather than through confrontation. This experience left a lasting impression on me, shaping how I approach challenges and disagreements in my life today.</p>
            <p>In the short term, this experience helped me become more aware of the impact my actions can have on others, prompting me to think before I act. In the long term, it has instilled in me a more measured and reflective approach to conflicts, allowing me to navigate challenges with greater poise and understanding.</p>

        <section class="gratitude">
            <h4 class="h4-gratitude">Words of Gratitude</h4>
            <p>As I reflect on my journey so far, I find myself filled with gratitude for the many people who have played a role in shaping the person I am today. First and foremost, I want to thank my family—my parents, siblings, and extended relatives—who have been my unwavering support system. Their love, guidance, and encouragement have been the foundation of all my achievements, and I am deeply thankful for the values they have instilled in me.</p>
            <p>I also want to express my heartfelt thanks to my friends. The friendships I have cultivated over the years have been a source of immense joy and strength. Whether through shared laughter, mutual support during tough times, or simply being there for one another, these bonds have enriched my life in countless ways. Many of these friendships have stood the test of time, and I am grateful to have such loyal and understanding people in my life.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I am thankful for the experiences—both the successes and the challenges—that have shaped my character. Each experience, no matter how big or small, has taught me something valuable, pushing me to grow and evolve. I am especially grateful for the lessons learned from the difficult moments, as they have made me more resilient and thoughtful.</p>
            <p>To everyone who has been a part of my journey, thank you. Your influence, whether direct or indirect, has helped me become who I am today, and I look forward to the continued journey of growth and discovery.</p>
